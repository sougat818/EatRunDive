      <description>The last tour I booked in Phuket was to the Similan Islands. I was told that it is extremely beautiful but didn’t really believe it. The pick up was at 6 am. After a two hour drive, we were at the Wow Andaman Pier in Lam Kaen. We were divided into different groups, identified by colour wristbands. Our guide introduced herself to us and she spoke really good English.</description>
